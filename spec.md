This utility is a CLI for printing labels based on to the Brother QL-700s. It's going to be a combination of a text and a URL.

What I'd like to have is a box icon. This is going to appear in black and white to the left of the QR code. And then, the text, the label in center, vertically aligned, large font and with the following font that I'll specify. And, a CLI to provide the URL firstly and then to provide the text to be written on the label.

The other change in the application is that it should be able to support different sizes of continuous length tape. That size in millimeters, where we currently have 29 mm, that's going to be fixed and then in continuous length tape, the other one, the other side is going to be unlimited basically.

So the options are, these are the different type parameters we should offer: 29 mm, 38 mm, 50 mm, and 62 mm.
